Local Men's Salon Website - Frontend Files

Hello GitHub Community, Welcome to the Local Men's Salon Website project repository! The files uploaded here represent the frontend part of the original website, which was built using: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Project Overview:
This repository includes:
HTML files
CSS stylesheets
Bootstrap components
Images and other assets

Important Note:
The complete website, initially connected to a database and customer management system, was hosted locally. Due to the local hosting being taken down, only the frontend files are available here.

**********************************************************************************************
Please be aware:

The files here do not include the complete functionality of the original website.
The website's full functionality, including database connectivity, was reliant on backend components, which are not part of this repository.

*********************************************************************************************

Feel free to explore and use these files for educational purposes or as a reference. If you intend to recreate the complete website, you'll need to develop and integrate the backend components separately.

Thank you for checking out the Salon Website frontend files! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the community.
